turnin code:  sdd_p2

point values:  20

Enhance project 1 to support multiple players.  In addition to the engine,
provide a server and client code named server.py and client.py, respectively.
The server should support 2 or more players.  The first player to attach gets
its pacman in the lower left.  The second should be in the upper right.  Others
should be placed at some 'predetermined' locations.
All players should be able to see all pacman characters.  Each pacman should be
a new color.

The interface to the server and client are as follows:
    python server.py port_for_listening
    python client.py host_of_server port_of_server
The "arrow" keys on the keyboard should be used for navigation.
A score should be displayed for the 'current' player.  It should be the number
of pellets eaten by that pacman.

Files containing images, sounds, etc. should be in the directory with the 
python code.

Use turnin to submit the program for grading.  Turnin a tar file containing
a directory which in turn contains the necessary files.

Grading will be done on the department's linuxNN systems.  You may be 
called upon to run your program for the class.
